This repository contains code to test the accuracy of the retriever for the [HCMUT Chatbot](https://www.ura.hcmut.edu.vn/bk-tvts/), which utilizes the *RAG* (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique. The primary goal is to determine whether there are any bugs or if the bugs are features :)) The code has been rebuilt from the retrieval component in the original repository `martinakaduc/hcmut-chatbot`, the main codebase for deploying the Chatbot.

> **Note:** For testing purposes, a free trial QDRANT database is used, which mirrors the structure of the primary database employed by the Chatbot.
